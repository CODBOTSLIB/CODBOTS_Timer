**Repository Name:** CODBOTS_Timer

**Description:** 
This repository contains a simple Arduino library for managing timers using ESP32 hardware timers. The library allows you to set up timers with callback functions, making it easy to schedule and manage periodic tasks in your ESP32-based projects. This example demonstrates how to use the CODBOTS_Timer library to create a timer that triggers a callback function at regular intervals.

**Installation:**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CODBOTS_Timer.git
   ```

2. Copy the `CODBOTS_Timer` folder to your Arduino libraries folder.

**Usage:**
1. Include the library in your Arduino sketch:
   ```cpp
   #include <CODBOTS_Timer.h>
   ```

2. Create an instance of the CODBOTS_Timer class and set up a callback function:
   ```cpp
   CODBOTS_Timer timer1(0);  // Create a timer using timer 0
   timer1.setCallback(&loop2, 1000);  // Set the callback function and delay (1000 ms)
   ```

3. In your Arduino sketch, define your callback function:
   ```cpp
   void loop2() {
     // Your code here...
   }
   ```

4. Start the timer:
   ```cpp
   timer1.start();
   ```

**Example:**

The provided example code (`example_timer.ino`) demonstrates how to use the library to create a timer that triggers a callback function at regular intervals. In the example, two functions, `loop()` and `loop2()`, are used to showcase the functionality of the library. The `loop2()` function toggles an LED on and off every second.
